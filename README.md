Below is a the instruction for a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application with server.js and app.js that builds up the lost and found management system

```markdown
# Lost and found management system Application

Welcome to our MERN stack application! This application is built using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

## Project Structure

- `server.js`: This file contains the server-side logic using Node.js and Express.js. It handles API requests, connects to the MongoDB database, and serves as the backend for the application.

- `app.js`: This is the entry point for the React frontend. It houses the client-side logic and components, providing the user interface for the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-mern-app.git
   cd your-mern-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the server and client:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

- **Database**: Configure your MongoDB connection string in `server.js`.
